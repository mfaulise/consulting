## Geo Spatial R&D Project

With access to a large set of mobile user location data, Downtown
AI set to explore various kinds of insights that could be gleaned.
At the time I joined the project, exploration was underway to find
tools capable of visualizing incrediblly large sets of data.

## Role

I helped explore visualization tools such as OmniSci (previous MapD)
and ArcGIS. I worked with the data providers to build tools for
the management and transfer of these large data sets.

We worked in Google Cloud (GCP). The project required us to use
very large compute instances with more than 16 GPUs. I helped
build systems to manage these instances and ensure that they ran
for a minimal amount of time to reduce costs.

## Technologies

* Python
* GCP
* Big Query
* Google Storage
* ArcGIS
* OmniSci

## Outcome

We were able to find solutions that allowed these large datasets to
be visualized in real-time, but unfortunately, the project ended shortly
after due to a lack of funding.
