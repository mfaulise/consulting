## Geo Spatial R&D Project

With access to a large set of mobile user location data, Downtown
AI set to explore what kinds of insights could be gathered. At the
time I joined the project, exploration was underway to find tools
capable of visualizing incredible large sets of data.

## Role

I helped explore visualization tools such as OmniSci (previous MapD)
and ArcGIS. I worked with the data providers to build tools for 
management and transfer of these large data sets.

We worked in Google Cloud (GCP). The project required us to use
very large compute instances with in excess of 16 GPUs. I helped
build systems to manage these instances and ensure that they were
running for a minimal amount of time to help reduce costs.

## Technologies

* Python
* GCP
* Big Query
* Google Storage
* ArcGIS
* OmniSci

## Outcome

We were able to find solutions that allowed these large datasets to
be visualized in real time, but unfortunately, the project ended shortly 
after due to a lack of funding.
