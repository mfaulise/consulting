## Bookmaker

This was an exciting project aimed at young children. The application was
an interactive book in which the children would place stickers and draw on the 
pages. This allowed them to be creative and express themselves in a unique
and satisfying way.

## Role

I built this application from the ground up using Flash and Action Script 3.
It was my first experience with Flash and I was impressed with how much I could
accomplish. 

## Technologies

* Flash
* Action Script 3

## Outcomes

The end result was very slick. Page turning animations made reading the books
very satisfying. The ability to draw on the pages and to add stickers brought
the entire thing to life. We ended the project just after adding a saving and
loading feature but before we implemented exporting to PDF.
