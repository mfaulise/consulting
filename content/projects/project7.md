## Aural Analytics

[Aural Analytics](https://auralanalytics.com/) offers a platform that
leverages AI to analyze speech patterns aiding in the early detection
of neurological disorders such as Parkinson's, ALS, and Alzheimer's.

## Role

I was brought on the project with the directive to help the Data Science
team author professional code. There was a small team of highly talented
Data Scientists that were writing Python scripts for data processing and
models for speech analysis. Senior Leadership felt that there was an
excellent opportunity for improvement in the team by learning some of the
techniques I teach such as:

- Code Quality (Identification and vocabulary)
- Testing
- Refactoring
- Working with Legacy Code

This was a small organization and many of the other programmers expressed
a strong desire to learn as well. So, we rolled out several learning
programs.

## Technologies

- Python
- Unit Testing

## Outcome

I was very impressed with how quickly the Data Scientists embraced these
new techniques and ideas. It was heart-warming to see them working and
collaborating more closely and showing and overall improvement in their
job satisfaction.

Since working with them, some have approached me outside Aural Analytics
to continue learning. Together, we started my first non-work mentoring
program. It is designed for students and professionals that do not have
their own teams with whom to learn and study. It has been very successful.
