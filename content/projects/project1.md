## Educare Test Platform

This project built a platform to receive, grade, and correlate test
results from standardized tests across Mexico. The platform allowed teachers
to upload tests, recorded the results, and presented detailed 
reports. User roles such as administrators, teachers, and students allowed
for tailored access to the data and reports.

## Role

I built both the frontend and the backend of the platform. I also managed the 
databases and built the installation and configuration software.

## Technologies

* ASP.NET
* Javascript
* SQL Server
* Windows Server
* Windows Installer

## Outcomes

The project was very successful. It was in use part way through development.
Features were added and bugs fixed towards the end of the project. The
client was very excited to see their ideas take shape.
