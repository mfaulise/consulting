## Educare Test Platform

Developed a comprehensive platform to manage standardized test results across
Mexico. The platform enabled teachers to upload test data, automated result
recording, and provided detailed performance reports. User roles — including
administrators, teachers, and students — ensured tailored access to relevant
data and insights.

## Role

I built both the frontend and the backend of the platform. I also managed the
databases and built the installation and configuration software.

## Technologies

* ASP.NET
* Javascript
* SQL Server
* Windows Server
* Windows Installer

## Outcomes

The project was very successful. It was in use part way through development.
Features were added and bugs fixed towards the end of the project. The
client was very excited to see their ideas take shape.
