**2013-2014**

## NxTomo

This was an ambitious project to help build a highly scalable international
gaming platform. It involved developers from all over the world.

## Role

My role was that of a Python Developer. I focused on the backend systems
such as authentication, persistence and observability. I also assisted
with strategic planning and staffing. Finally, I helped improve the internal
testing codebase.

Scalability was a concern so we built the backend systems to take advantage 
of job queueing and offline processing in hopes of meeting and exceeding their
growth requirements.

## Technologies

* Python
* Django/Celery
* MySQL/MongoDB
* Linux
* Splunk

## Outcome

This was the beginning of the NxTomo platform which later became a 
huge success in Asia. By this point I had left the project, but 
ground-work we laid contributed to the the company's growth and success.
