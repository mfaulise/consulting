## Iris Booth

Iris Booth provides photo booth installations for security and corporate events.
They build the hardware used on location and the software through which the users
can get access to their photos.

## Role

I was contracted to help this small company get their technical debt under control.
I acted as a technical advisor and helped the company change it's direction to
develop the technical expertise. I reviewed code, helped with staffing, mentored
programmers, helped with security assessments, and advised senior leadership.

## Technologies

* AWS
* Python

## Outcome

Achieving a high level technical competency was critical for Iris Booth. It
brought peace of mind to the company's owners and allowed them to focus on
other matters. As of my last conversation, Iris Booth was being sold and the
owners were getting ready to retire. I cannot think of a better success
story for them.
