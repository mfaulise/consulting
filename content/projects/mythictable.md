**2019-Present**

[Mythic Table](https://www.mythictable.com/) is an open-source virtual
tabletop platform for playing games like Dungeons & Dragons with
friends online. It is an open-source, non-profit project built and designed
by volunteers from the community.

## Role

I am the last remaining founder of this project. My role is that
of Lead Director. I oversee all operations of Mythic Table, from finance
and development to community management, project management and business
development. It is a role with a lot of responsibility but also a lot of
satisfaction and opportunities to learn and grow.

## Technologies

* Vue.js
* C#/.net
* Python
* Java
* MongoDB
* Postgres
* GCP
* Kubernetes

## Outcome

Mythic Table has had moderate success. We ran a successful Kickstarter
and have Patreon supporters who help us with our infrastructure costs.
At the same time, it is not self-sufficient yet and as such, does not
have any full-time staff.
