## About Me

I'm a Software and DevOps Consultant with a passion for helping teams build better software. With over 20 years of experience, I specialize in:

- **DevOps Transformations** – Empowering teams to streamline their development pipelines, improve deployment processes, and enhance overall productivity.
- **Productivity Improvement** – Identifying bottlenecks and introducing solutions that help teams deliver faster, smarter, and with greater confidence.
- **Solutions Development** – Writing code from scratch, adding features, and wrestling large codebases under control. If it runs on a computer, I can build it.
- **Mentoring** – Supporting developers at all levels to improve their skills and become more effective contributors. I focus on **Code Quality** and **Testing Methodologies**.

In addition to these core services, I'm highly experienced in:

- Building and improving codebases of any size, from startup projects to large-scale enterprise applications.
- Working across a wide range of technologies, including:
  - **Over a dozen programming languages**
  - **Three major cloud providers** (AWS, Azure, GCP)
  - **Six leading database platforms**

## Experience

I'm the founder of the **Mythic Table** project, an open-source virtual tabletop platform designed to bring tabletop roleplaying games to life. While I have extensive experience in the **game industry**, I'm equally comfortable working in other sectors, including **healthcare**, **finance**, and **education**.

My diverse background allows me to approach technical challenges from multiple angles, ensuring effective and creative solutions tailored to your project's needs.

## Personal Interests

When I'm not working with clients, you'll often find me embracing my hobbies:

- **Dungeons & Dragons** and other tabletop RPGs
- **Sailing/Kayaking**, exploring the open water and chasing the wind
- **Snowboarding**, carving my way down mountain slopes
- **Biking**, whether it's on trails, roads, or gravel paths using pedal or gas

I bring the same passion and dedication to my work that I do to my hobbies. Whether you're looking to refine your development processes, improve your codebase, or inspire your team, I'm here to help you succeed.
