Investing in your team is investing in your organization. A
good development team can make a huge difference in the success
of a modern company.

Mentoring has two primary outcomes for me:

1. Level up programmers
1. Improve morale

## Leveling up

The craft of software development is very nuanced. It is very
unlikely that a beginner programmer will stumble across the 
techniques that we learn and hone over the years. For this 
reason, mentoring is an excellent way to accelerate this learning.

I specialize in leveling up junior and intermediate programmers.
For senior and higher, I help them sharpen existing skills and
teach them how they can grow in a variety of directions:

* Mentoring themselves
* New Disciplines like DevOps and Management
* New Skills like Test-Driven Development or Refactoring

## Morale

Leveling up is the obvious result of mentoring. However, I have
had experiences that show that mentoring is a powerful tool for
improving morale. This is especially true in today's remote workforce.
I have found that meeting even once a week with a focus on personal
development is even to help employees feel more connected and
appreciated.

## Subjects

I teach the follow:

1. Quality Code (Identification and Vocabulary)
1. Testing Techniques
1. Refactoring
1. Working with Legacy Code
1. DevOps Principles and Tools

## Format

I tend to encourage a low impact format that is meant to accompany
an organization's standard workload. This format is a weekly one
hour meeting. Programmers are encouraged to do reading and exercises
on their own and to integrate their learnings into their day-to-day
work. The goal is that, over time, the developers learn and grow 
together.
