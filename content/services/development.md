As a Software Engineer, I can develop your application with
a wide variety of tools and languages and in several environments.
I have experience working in the Game Industry, Healthcare, and
Education. I have worked to build social applications, non-profit
and open-source applications, GIS applications and more. WhWhatever
your needs are, I can help you bring them to life.

The following is a brief list of programming languages I am proficient in:

* C/C++
* C#/.net

* Java/Scala
* PHP/Perl/Lua/Action Script

## Activities

* Web Service Development (APIs)

## Databases

The following is a short list of Databases with which I am familiar

* MySQL/MariaDB
* Postgres
* SQL Server
* MongoDB

## Approach

I have a pragmatic approach to software development. There is a 
time and place for borrowing from Technical Debt. Software testing
is a critical step in developing quality software on time and under
budget. The most important factor in building software is delivering
value to the customer
