As a DevOps Engineering, I can help your organization reach
new heights of productivity and effectiveness. The goal of
any good DevOps Engineer is to help a business succeed.
I do this by taking a holistic approach to DevOps that considers
the objectives of an organization while holding to the DevOps
principles. This should result in the following:

* Greater customer satisfaction through improving the quality of the product
* Higher business agility allowing the organization to respond to new developments more quickly
* Morale improvements as team members start to collaborate more closely and frustrations are eliminated
* Reduce development costs due to a reduction of Rework and Toil

## Activities

* Building Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
* Building Pipelines (CI/CD)
* Automating User Management (IAM)
* Automating Security
* Building Application Deployment Strategies
* Application and Development Observability
* Team Enablement
* Training and Mentoring

## Tools

I tend to lean towards the following tools, but I'm happy to use whatever is needed for the job:

* Terraform/Terragrunt
* Kubernetes
* AWS/GCP/Azure
* Python/Bash/Power Shell/Make
* Linux/Windows/MacOS
* Github Actions/Gitlab Pipelines/AWS Code Build and Pipelines

I'm also familiar with the following though I don't employ them as often:

* Pulumi/Cloud Formation
* Opsworks/Chef/Ansible
* Semaphore/Jenkins/Team City

## Approach

My approach to DevOps is very pragmatic. While I have a list of tools
I lean on, my objectives are driven by the DevOps Fundamentals.
I follow the three ways of DevOps:

* Improve the flow of work from left to right
* Improve the quality and timeliness of feedback from right to left
* Build a culture of continual improvement

### Evidence-based Improvements

I strongly recommend that we build an organization-wide development health
dashboard. We use this dashboard to track key metrics
to measure how we are doing in our DevOps approach. The metrics
we track are as follow:

* Deployment Frequency
* Lead time to Deployment
* Percent Complete and Accurate (percentages of releases with defects)
* Mean time to recovery

Putting these metrics in-front of the entire team helps us align
towards our DevOps principles and helps to keep us motivated and
moving in the right direction.
