Early in my career, I realized how important productivity can be.
It can impact quality of life, success of projects, budgets and so
much more. I began my journey of improving productivity over twenty
years ago. It wasn't until recently that all the pieces really began
to come together and I started to see the relationships between how
we work and our productivity.

## Approach

I take a holistic approach to productivity improvement projects. I
like to look at the organization as a whole to understand how it
currently works and where the necessary changes must take place.
This means that I won't focus on a single department. Understanding
how work flows and how decisions are made is a critical part of
improving an organization's productivity.

I draw from my DevOps learning for productivity improvement, and I
use the same [metrics](../devops/#evidence-based-improvements) for
both. These are as follows:

* Deployment Frequency
* Lead time to Deployment
* Percent Complete and Accurate (percentages of releases with defects)
* Mean time to recovery

The first thing I will do it to work with stakeholders and team members
to capture these metrics and to put them in-front of everyone.
After that, I will join the teams, watch how they work, conduct
several interviews and try to map how work is done and how decisions
are made at the organization.

Once done, I help the organization make the necessary changes and 
observe the results. Often, these changes take time, but sometimes
the results can be seen immediately especially with improvements
in inventory (WIP) reduction.
